# Capstone-Project
Name: Abdel Gumih
- Design Tools used: Visual Studio/Basic
- Issues Encountered:
  * At first, the images I was uploading would not get saved until I figured that currently it was best to save them to a textfile and load them from there.
  * I had to do some research to figure out that the solultion of saving the details and images when navigating through the different forms would be to use Module.
  * I wanted to make navigating the diffirent profiles by using right and left arrows, but that turned out to be more difficult than anticipated.
